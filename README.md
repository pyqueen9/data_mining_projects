# data_mining_projects

The following classifiers are implemented in Python:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Neural Network
3. Association Rule Mining

The scripts also implement parsing of the dataset files and preprocessing steps for the data including entropy-based discretization for nominal attributes and filling in missing values.

For the NB & NN classifiers, the dataset "adult-big.arff" was used and for the ARM the products and basket files were used and can be found in the data folder.
