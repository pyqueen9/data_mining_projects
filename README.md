# data_mining_projects

The following classifiers are implemented in Python:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Neural Network
3. Association Rule Mining

The scripts also implement parsing of the dataset files and preprocessing steps for the data including normalization and filling in missing values.

For the NB & NN classifiers, the dataset "adult-big.arff" was used and for the ARM the products and basket files were used.

The results folder contains sample output for each project.
